# Rendering API

With React you build the DOM using JavaScript objects (Virtual DOM) instead of the alternative that most developers are familiar with ‚Äî templating.

By using the VDOM; React can find the difference of DOM trees (on application state change) before rendering and only re-render the changed nodes, similar to the way merging with GIT works.

This allows React to render components much faster than most other competing frameworks

The React API is worded similarly to the native APIs made for DOM manipulation that already exist on the modern web platforms.

```js
// üç¶Vanilla
const rootElement = document.getElementById("root")

const element = document.createElement("div") // tagName
element.className = "container" // properties
element.appendChild(document.createTextNode("Hello!")) // children

rootElement.appendChild(element) // render
```

___
```js
// ‚öõÔ∏èReact
const rootElement = document.getElementById("root")

const element = React.createElement("div", { className: "container" }, "Hello!")
                              //   tagName        properties           children

ReactDOM.render(element, rootElement) // render
```

# JSX

It is possible to write a React application only by using the `React.createElement` API, but it can be hard to maintain ‚Äî so Facebook invented an abstraction layer called JSX, which allows us to work with elements in a manner that we're more accustomed to: HTML.

It is not completely like HTML, it still relies on the same data structures as the raw API ‚Äî for example; differences like the `className` property instead of using `class`.

JSX needs to be transpiled to regular JavaScript using a transpiler, like Babel, that will turn the JSX element declarations into `React.createElement` function calls.

Summarized ‚Äî JSX is **highly** recommended syntactic sugar when building a React application

# [JSX Transpilation](/subjects/01-jsx/)

Here you can see the abstraction in action ‚Äî which, arguably, results in much more readable code.

```jsx
// JSX
const element = <div className="container">Hello!</div>

```
___

```js
// Transpiled üîÄ
const element = React.createElement("div", { className: "container" }, "Hello!")

```

# Components

In React, components are simply functions that return a react element (JSX). Components must be pure ‚Äî which means that they must not modify the `props` that they are passed or rely on external state that is not passed through `props`.

There is two ways to write a React component:

ü§ñ Dumb Components

  ‚Äî are simple functions that take input (`props`) and returns JSX. They are stateless, primarily presentational and are often used as small UI parts that are composed together in smart components.

üß† Smart Components

  ‚Äî are, typically, class based functions that contain application state and can trigger re-render upon state change. These are commonly where you would make fetch requests and other logic that is not view specific.

---

# [ü§ñ Dumb Component](/subjects/02-components/dumb.html)

```jsx
// Dumb component utilized with interpolation (curly braces within JSX)
const greeting = props => <div className="container">{props.content}</div>
const element = (
  <div className="app">
    {greeting({ content: "Hello from component"})}
  </div>
)
```
___

```jsx
// Better way ‚Äî using JSX by following recommended conventions
const Greeting = props => <div className="container">{props.content}</div>
const element = (
  <div className="app">
    <Greeting content="Hello from component" />
  </div>
)
```
Using CamelCased naming for your component functions allows the JSX transpiler to know that it is referencing a variable  ‚Äî otherwise it will try to interpretate it as a `tagName` string.

---

# [üß† Smart Component](/subjects/02-components/smart.html)

Smart components are typically based on the the react Component class, which implements a number of useful lifecycle hooks and methods.

The render method is run every time a passed `prop` or internal `state` is changed.

A re-render will not be triggered upon mutation ‚Äî React does not use two-way databinding.

```jsx
class Counter extends React.Component {
  state = { count: 0 }
  // methods that alter state without mutation ‚Äî triggering a component re-render
  increment = () => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })
  decrement = () => this.setState({ count: this.state.count - 1 })

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="counter">
        {this.state.count}
        <button onClick={this.increment}>+</button>
        <button onClick={this.decrement}>-</button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```
