# Rendering API

With React you build the DOM using JavaScript objects (Virtual DOM) instead of the alternative that most developers are familiar with ‚Äî templating.

By using the VDOM; React can find the difference of DOM trees (on application state change) before rendering and only re-render the changed nodes, similar to the way merging with GIT works.

This allows React to render components much faster than most other competing frameworks

# [ReactDOM](/subjects/00-react-dom/)

The React API is worded similarly to the native APIs made for DOM manipulation that already exist on the modern web platforms.

```js
// üç¶Vanilla
const element = document.createElement("div") // tagName
element.className = "container" // properties
element.appendChild(document.createTextNode("Hello!")) // children

document.getElementById("root").appendChild(element) // render
```

___
```js
// ‚öõÔ∏èReact
const element = React.createElement("div", { className: "container" }, "Hello!")
                              //   tagName        properties           children

ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById("root")) // render
```

# JSX

It is possible to write a React application only by using the `React.createElement` API, but it can be hard to maintain ‚Äî so Facebook has invented an abstraction layer called JSX, which allows us to work with elements in a manner that we're more accustomed to: HTML.

It is not completely like HTML, it still relies on the same data structures as the raw API ‚Äî for example; differences like the `className` property instead of using `class`.

JSX needs to be transpiled to regular JavaScript using a transpiler, like Babel, that will turn the JSX element declarations into `React.createElement` function calls.

Summarized ‚Äî JSX is **highly** recommended syntactic sugar when building a React application

# [JSX Transpilation](/subjects/01-jsx/)

Here you can see the abstraction in action ‚Äî which, arguably, results in much more readable code.

```jsx
// JSX
const element = <div className="container">Hello!</div>

```
___

```js
// üîÄTranspiled
const element = React.createElement("div", { className: "container" }, "Hello!")

```

# Components

In React, components are simply functions that take `props` and returns a react element (JSX).

"React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can‚Äôt change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time." (no two-way databinding)

With React all you need to know is how to make and compose components, there are no other concepts in terms of functionality (like other frameworks with directives etc.)

There is two ways to write a React component:
___

ü§ñ Dumb Components

‚Äî are simple functions that take input (`props`) and returns JSX. They are stateless, primarily presentational and are often used as small UI parts that are composed together in smart components.
___
üß† Smart Components

‚Äî are, typically, class based functions that contain application state and can trigger re-render upon state change. These are commonly where you would make fetch requests and other logic that is not view specific.

---

# [ü§ñ Dumb Component](/subjects/02-components/dumb.html)

```jsx
// Dumb component utilized as function
const greeting = props => <div className="container">{props.content}</div>
const element = greeting({ content: "Hello from component"})

ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById("root"))
```
___

```jsx
// Better way ‚Äî using JSX by following recommended conventions
const Greeting = props => <div className="container">{props.content}</div>
const element = <Greeting content="Hello from component" />

ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById("root"))
```
Using CamelCased naming for your component functions allows the JSX transpiler to know that it is referencing a variable  ‚Äî otherwise it will try to interpretate it as a `tagName` string.

---

# [üß† Smart Component](/subjects/02-components/smart.html)

Smart components are typically based on the the React Component class, which implements a number of useful lifecycle hooks and methods.

The render method is run every time a passed `prop` or internal `state` is changed.

```jsx
class Counter extends React.Component {
  state = { count: 0 } // initial component state

  // methods that alter state without mutation triggering a component re-render
  increment = () => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })
  decrement = () => this.setState({ count: this.state.count - 1 })

  render() { // must implement render method that returns JSX
    return (
      <div className="counter">
        {this.state.count}
        <button onClick={this.increment}>+</button>
        <button onClick={this.decrement}>-</button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<Counter />, document.getElementById("root"))
```
---
# [üö¶ Asynchronicity](/subjects/02-components/async.html)

It is recommended to use the component lifecycle hook `componentWillMount` for handling asynchronous logic.

This allows React to potentially fetch the data before it tries to render the component ‚Äî minimizing the amount of times the component is re-rendered.

```jsx
class Book extends React.Component {
  state = { data: null }

  componentWillMount() { // will be called before first render
    const { isbn } = this.props
    fetch('https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=isbn:' + isbn)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }))
  }

  render() {
    if (!this.state.data) return null // handling when data is not loaded
    const book = this.state.data.items[0]
    return <img className="book" src={book.volumeInfo.imageLinks.thumbnail} />
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<Book isbn="0345816021" />, document.getElementById("root"))
```
---
# [Repeaters?](/subjects/02-components/lists.html)

The way to do repition, like a list view, is just to use JavaScript's built-in array methods like `map` and `reduce` and return a React Element per iteration ‚Äî generating a new array to be used as `children`.

One important thing to note is that it is recommended to attach a key property to each repeated instance containing a unique value (preferrably an ID). This helps React's diff calculation know what has changed between render calls ‚Äî optimizing performance.

```jsx
const items = ["üôà", "üôâ", "üôä"]

const List = props => (
  <ul>
    {props.items.map((item, index) => <li key={item}>{item}</li>)}
  </ul>
)

ReactDOM.render(<List items={items}/>, document.getElementById("root"))
```
